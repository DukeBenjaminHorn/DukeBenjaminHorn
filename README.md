- 👋 Hi, I’m @DukeBenjaminHorn
- 👀 I’m interested in intelligent multiverses, the possibility of x>1 type civilizations, how our 'collision' with the Andromeda Galaxy will affect humanity's sense of self, Europa as a water source for Mars, precusors to Martian settlement, socializing people into astronauts, spaceports, medicine, and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C-languages, Github, Linux, and medicinal physics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source, HIPPA compliant medical software projects that aim to eliminate costs of human care and hedge against the failed promise(s) and/or implementation(s) of Universal Basic Income.
- 📫 How to reach me--on twitter @Duke_Horn.
