- 👋 Hi, I’m @DukeBenjaminHorn
- 👀 I’m interested in intelligent multiverses, the possibility of x>1 type civilizations, how our 'collision' with the Andromeda Galaxy will affect humanity's sense of self, Europa as a water source for Mars, precusors to Martian settlement, socializing people into astronauts, spaceports, medicine, and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C-languages, Github, Linux, and medicinal physics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source, HIPPA compliant medical software projects that aim to eliminate costs of human healthcare and hedge against the failed promise(s) and/or implementation(s) of Universal Basic Income. This includes disaster projects that aim to move the human genome [not consciousness] to Keplers in the event that we dont become advanced enough to 1) terraform Mars 2) harness the 'entire' energy of our solar system and 3) develop and understanding of how to manufacture stars--Origami.
- 📫 How to reach me--on twitter @Duke_Horn.
